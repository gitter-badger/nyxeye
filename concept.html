<p>
The main purpose of the development of this project was, the research of the risks and possible exploits, exploring the "daily used techs" and the way the Web is being implemented, such as websites, browsers, javascripts and all that which makes your “web surfing” experiences possible, practical, eye candy and addicting.
</p>

<p>
As a mean of request interception (propagation stage), the system boots up an "Highly Anonymous" Http Proxy instance, serving all requests while logging all the dataflow. Every incoming request is analysed by "Deep Url Inspection / Injection" prototypes, checking for the targeted filetype. On match, that file is gathered by the system, injected with the desired payload, and normally served to the request origin. 
</p>

<p>
There are several uses and ways to use NYXEYE. On the propagation stage, numerous known attack techniques can be used to increase the propagation rate (Pineapple'ing through NYXEYE is one of my personnal favourites). On the infection stage, the payloads is up to your desires (and tech limitation, off course). The current payload sample, collects data and cookies, providing also keylogging capabilities.
</p>

<p>
With the research results and inner deep insights of several attack vectors, we hope to get a broader view on the current and future risks, along with viable wide scale mitigation technologies development.
